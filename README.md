# Game Slam Template
 This is a template for first and second years to use for the game jam and other GCS projects

# Plugins used:

 Cinemachine - 
  Cinemachine is a camera system that allows dynamic camera movement. This can be used for creating cutscenes, smoothly follow a character or object, or even change perspective of the player based on conditions!

 New Input System - 
  The new input system Unity has released is a very important and powerful tool to get use to. Instead of manually assigning a button to an action, you can set up a far more modular system where any controller or keyboard can work. This is very, very powerful - study this!

 Splines - 
  Splines are essentially curves. This plugin helps to create these curves easily without needing to do a bunch of math! Some of the features you can do with it are creating a path of nodes and have a camera follow it to create cinimatics or make objects move smoothly along a curved path!

 TMP Essentials - 
  This is a component of an extremely useful text rendering plugin, TextMesh Pro (TMP). Everyone will use this plugin a lot while at NAIT, as this is how you render text onto the screen, think UI elements, hovering health bars, and damage numbers!
